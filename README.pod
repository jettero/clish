Term::ReadLine::CLISH â€” command line interface shell

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is a bundle of OO interfaces to quickly built shells with tab completion
and context help. It is intended to feel like a certain unnamed embedded
operating system.

=head1 NAME

I loved the CLISH project, but ultimately didn't want to do this in that way.  I
wanted Perl, obviously, and didn't want to deal with XML.  I don't personally
find it human readable (ymmv).

L<http://clish.sourceforge.net/>

I asked the author if he minded, and he did not.  We feel the names are
sufficiently different that it wouldn't cause any confusion for anyone, and even
if it did (he said) it's not trademarked anyway.
