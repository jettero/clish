- planned for this release
  - tab completion
  - '?' help key binding

- command objects should be definable in files other than their path names!!
  - more than one class per file seems minimum necessary for sanity
  - more than one command() per classname would allow
  - command nicknames exit ⇒ quit
  - binding to a textfile format or a script to build commands

- shell-like features
    - command aliases? alias blarg ⇒ quit
    - user macros?  Probably aliases and macros are doable in boring "userspace" commands
    - compound commands? blarg ; blarg?
    - command continuations? blarg \r blarg
    - variables? set blarg 7 ; ping $blarg
