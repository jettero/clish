- planned for this release
  - tab completion
  - '?' help key binding

- hrm... I'm spending so much time getting
  - !debug and debug on, debug off to work right
  - shouldn't it instead be this though???
    my-shell> config terminal
    my-shell(config)> debug
    my-shell(config)> no debug
    my-shell(config)> exit
    my-shell>

- command objects should be definable in files other than their path names!!
  - more than one class per file seems minimum necessary for sanity
  - more than one command() per classname would allow
  - command nicknames exit ⇒ quit
  - binding to a textfile format or a script to build commands

- shell-like features
  - command aliases? alias blarg ⇒ quit
  - user macros?  Probably aliases and macros are doable in boring "userspace"
    commands
  - compound commands? blarg ; blarg?
  - command continuations? blarg \r blarg
  - variables? set blarg 7 ; ping $blarg

- windows (etc)
  - I'm pretty much a strictly linux guy, I plan to make this all
    multiplatform, but for my needs, it just needs to work in linux.  But in
    principle, there's no reason it shouldn't work in other platforms.  I'm
    just not being very careful (e.g., File::Spec, File::Homedir, etc).
