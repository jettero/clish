   - started adding real tests to the package … better place to test new parser things anyway

   - got a SIGINT handler working reliably and correctly (by copying an example
     in the Term::ReadLine::Gnu distribution — actually started with
     AnyEvent::ReadLine::Gnu, but it's actually *less* clear)
   - I think I now definitely require the ::Gnu version of ReadLine though …
   - there, test for some things so we work under ::Perl
   - figured out how to actually do the tab completion from the example in ::Gnu/eg/perlsh
     [it's not obvious like you'd think]

   - did boatloads of work on the parser (all week actualy)

   - restructure the messaging system
   - built a really basic parser (with lots of fur and bugs)

   - trying to get my thoughts together
   - wrote the very first shell loop
   - made a parser that loads commands (but doesn't parse anything, yet)
